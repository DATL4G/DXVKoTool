# DXVKoTool

**Manage your DXVK game caches easily.**

The DXVKoTool extracts DXVK caches of games automatically and can update them with caches provided in this [repository](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/dxvk-caches/tree/main/dxvk-caches)

## âš  WARNING!!!

This tool is in a very early state.

Additionally it's my first time working with compose ðŸ˜¬.

**Current functionality:**

- List Steam games
- Export DXVK caches
  - Considers valid entries only!
    - Could fix broken caches
- Merge with found and downloaded caches
  - Creates backup file (no worries)
  - Check entry size difference on downloaded files
    - only mergable if more entries available
- Update entry size text after merge
- WIP: Show more information in Snackbar on actions
  
**Planned functionality:**

- Add other games on your own
  - not Steam games only
- Don't show ```None found``` during first availability check
- Add information dialog
- Package a single AppImage
  - not the whole directory
  - HELP WANTED
